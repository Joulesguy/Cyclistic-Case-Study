Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company, was established in 2016 and is headquartered in the vibrant city of Chicago. With a robust infrastructure comprising over 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations strategically positioned across the city, Cyclistic has become a prominent player in the urban mobility landscape. 
Since its inception, the program has expanded significantly, now boasting a fleet of 5,824 bicycles meticulously tracked via geotracking technology. These bicycles are securely locked into a vast network of 692 stations strategically distributed throughout the city of Chicago.

As a Junior Data Analyst at Cyclistic, my current assignment involves conducting a comprehensive analysis of the company's bike share program. The primary objectives of this analysis are to discern the distinctions between annual members and casual riders, explore the motivations behind casual riders' potential acquisition of a membership, and evaluate the potential impact of digital media on the company's marketing strategies.
